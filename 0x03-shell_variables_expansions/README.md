# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project is part of the ALX Foundations of Linux and Version Control module.  
It covers:

- Shell initialization files (.bashrc, .profile, etc.)
- Environment variables vs local variables
- Shell expansions (arithmetic, variables, command substitution, etc.)
- Customizing the shell environment

Each script in this directory is written in Bash and is exactly two lines long, starting with `#!/bin/bash`.
