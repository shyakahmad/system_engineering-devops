# 0x05. Processes and Signals

This project introduces basic Linux process management, including how to find and manage process IDs (PIDs), send signals to processes, and use commands like `ps`, `kill`, `pkill`, `nice`, and `renice`.

Topics covered:

- What is a PID
- How to list running processes
- How to show information about a given process
- What is a process and what is a thread
- How to manipulate processes using signals
- What is the role of `kill`, `pkill`, and `signal` numbers

Each task in this project includes a Bash script that demonstrates one or more of these concepts.
